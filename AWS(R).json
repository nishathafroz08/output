    "answer": "VM monitoring focuses on infrastructure metrics like CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network throughput, and system-level logs using tools like CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, or Stackdriver. Application performance monitoring tracks response times, error rates, and custom business metrics. Serverless monitoring emphasizes function-specific metrics including invocation count, duration, error rates, concurrent executions, and cold start frequency. Distributed tracing becomes crucial for serverless to track requests across multiple functions. Tools like AWS X-Ray, Azure Application Insights, and third-party solutions provide specialized serverless observability with different pricing models and data retention strategies.",

    "answer": "VM security requires managing OS patches, firewall configurations, access controls, antivirus software, network security groups, and encryption at rest/in transit. Organizations are responsible for the entire software stack above the hypervisor. Serverless security shifts focus to function code security, IAM permissions, environment variables protection, dependency management, and input validation. Cloud providers handle infrastructure security, but developers must secure application logic, manage secrets properly, implement least-privilege access, and monitor for vulnerabilities in function dependencies. Serverless reduces attack surface but requires different security expertise and tools.",

This is because IaaS provides the highest level of control over the virtualized infrastructure, including the operating system, middleware, and runtime environments. This granular control is crucial for migrating complex legacy applications with specific dependencies, allowing the enterprise to replicate its existing on-premise environment more closely in the cloud.",
